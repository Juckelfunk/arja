# Dataset of Patches for Overfit Detection  

This dataset includes 122 plausible patches (including 97 incorrect patches and 25 correct patches),
which come from three repair approaches: ARJA-e, jGenProg and jKali. 

For each repair approach, the directory "patches" lists 
the first plausible patches found for some bugs, and the file "correctness.info"
labels the correctness of these patches that is confirmed by the manual study.
